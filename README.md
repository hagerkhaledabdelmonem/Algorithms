# Algorithms
Set of finite steps to solve certain problem

## Goal:
 - Think
 - Design
 - Analyze

## Learn some algorithms:
 - Divide & Conquer (DC)
 - Greedy
 - Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Skills that I Learn
- Becomes a better programmer
- Sharpen the mathematical and analytical skills
- Start “thinking algorithmically”
