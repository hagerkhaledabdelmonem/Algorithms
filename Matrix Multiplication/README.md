# Matrix Multiplication
## Description
Given TWO square matrices of size N×N, implement an efficient algorithm based on Strassen’s method to multiply them

## NOTE:
N is power of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32… 2i)

## Complexity
The complexity of your algorithm should be less than O(N^3)

## Function Implemention 
static public int[,] MatrixMultiply(int[,] M1, int[,] M2, int N)
